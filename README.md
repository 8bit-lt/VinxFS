- Very small code size. Full version ~6400 bytes (80% of FLASH AMEGA8), 
- Single volume and two opened files.
- File write function with out restrictions.
- Can create, delete, rename, resize, move, file and directory

- fs_lseek - Move read/write pointer
- fs_tell - Get read/write pointer
- fs_getfilesize - Get file size
- fs_read0, fs_read - Read file
- fs_write - Write File
- fs_write_eof - Truncate file
- fs_write_start, fs_write_end - Write temporary buffer to a file

- sd_check - Check if user changed a drive
- sd_read - Read partial sector
- sd_write512 - Write sector

The module contains driver SD Card connected at ATMega8
